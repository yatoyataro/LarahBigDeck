# Delete Deck Feature - Implementation

## Overview
Added complete deck deletion functionality with confirmation dialog and automatic cleanup of all associated data.

---

## What Was Added

### 1. Enhanced `deleteDeck()` Function in `deckService.ts`

**Before:** Only deleted the deck record from database

**After:** Comprehensive deletion of all related data:
1. ‚úÖ Fetches all upload records associated with the deck
2. ‚úÖ Deletes files from Supabase Storage (`deck-uploads` bucket)
3. ‚úÖ Deletes upload records from database
4. ‚úÖ Deletes all cards in the deck
5. ‚úÖ Deletes the deck itself

**Code Flow:**
```typescript
async function deleteDeck(deckId: string) {
  // 1. Get all uploads for this deck
  // 2. For each upload, extract file path and delete from storage
  // 3. Delete upload records
  // 4. Delete all cards
  // 5. Delete the deck
}
```

**Storage Cleanup:**
- Extracts file path from storage URL
- Removes files using `supabase.storage.from('deck-uploads').remove([filePath])`
- Handles errors gracefully (logs but continues)

---

### 2. Added Delete Button to Study Page (`Study.tsx`)

**Location:** Top-right of the page, next to "Back to Dashboard"

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Red "Delete Deck" button with trash icon
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog before deletion
- ‚úÖ Shows deck name and card count in confirmation
- ‚úÖ Loading state ("Deleting...") during operation
- ‚úÖ Success toast notification
- ‚úÖ Auto-navigates to dashboard after deletion
- ‚úÖ Error handling with toast notification

**UI Components Used:**
- `AlertDialog` - Confirmation dialog
- `AlertDialogTrigger` - Delete button
- `AlertDialogContent` - Modal content
- `AlertDialogTitle` - "Are you absolutely sure?"
- `AlertDialogDescription` - Warning message
- `AlertDialogCancel` - Cancel button
- `AlertDialogAction` - Confirm delete button

---

## User Flow

### Deleting a Deck:

```
1. User opens a deck (Study page)
2. Clicks "Delete Deck" button (top-right)
3. Confirmation dialog appears:
   - Title: "Are you absolutely sure?"
   - Message: "This will permanently delete the deck '[Deck Name]', 
              all [X] cards, and any associated files from storage."
   - Buttons: "Cancel" | "Delete Permanently"
4. User clicks "Delete Permanently"
5. System:
   a. Shows "Deleting..." on button
   b. Fetches upload records
   c. Deletes files from Supabase Storage
   d. Deletes upload records
   e. Deletes all cards
   f. Deletes deck
   g. Shows success toast
   h. Redirects to dashboard
6. Deck is gone forever (no undo)
```

## What Gets Deleted

### From Database:
1. **Deck record** - The deck itself
2. **All card records** - Every card in the deck
3. **Upload records** - File upload metadata
4. **Session records** - Study sessions (via cascade)
5. **Card stats** - Review history (via cascade)

### From Supabase Storage:
1. **Uploaded files** - PDFs, DOCX, PPTX files
   - Bucket: `deck-uploads`
   - Path format: `{user_id}/{timestamp}-{filename}`

---

## Security

### Authorization Checks:
- ‚úÖ Verifies user authentication
- ‚úÖ Checks deck ownership (`user_id` must match)
- ‚úÖ RLS policies enforce user isolation
- ‚úÖ Only owner can delete their decks

### Data Protection:
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- ‚úÖ Clear warning message shows what will be deleted
- ‚úÖ No undo - permanent deletion

---

## Error Handling

### During Deletion:
- Storage deletion errors ‚Üí Logged, continues anyway
- Upload deletion errors ‚Üí Logged, continues anyway
- Card deletion errors ‚Üí Logged, continues (cascade handles it)
- Deck deletion errors ‚Üí Thrown to user, stops process

### User Feedback:
```typescript
// Success
toast({
  title: "Deck deleted",
  description: "Deck and all associated data have been permanently removed"
})

// Error
toast({
  title: "Error deleting deck",
  description: error.message,
  variant: "destructive"
})
```

## Technical Details

### Supabase Storage Integration:

**File URL Format:**
```
https://<project>.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/deck-uploads/<user_id>/<filename>
```

**Extraction Logic:**
```typescript
const urlParts = upload.file_url.split('deck-uploads/')
const filePath = urlParts[1] // "{user_id}/{filename}"
```

**Deletion:**
```typescript
await supabase.storage
  .from('deck-uploads')
  .remove([filePath])
```

### Database Cascade:

Tables with cascade delete:
- `cards` ‚Üí Cascades to `card_stats`
- `decks` ‚Üí Cascades to `sessions`
- `sessions` ‚Üí Cascades to `session_cards`

Manually deleted:
- `uploads` - Explicitly deleted to clean up storage first
- `cards` - Explicitly deleted for clarity

## UI/UX Details

### Button Styling:
```tsx
<Button
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
  className="text-destructive hover:text-destructive hover:bg-destructive/10"
>
  <Trash2 className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  Delete Deck
</Button>
```

### Confirmation Dialog:
```tsx
<AlertDialogDescription>
  This action cannot be undone. This will permanently delete the deck
  <span className="font-semibold"> "{deck.name}"</span>, all{" "}
  <span className="font-semibold">{deckCards.length} cards</span>,
  and any associated files from storage.
</AlertDialogDescription>
```

### Delete Button (Action):
```tsx
<AlertDialogAction
  onClick={handleDeleteDeck}
  className="bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90"
>
  Delete Permanently
</AlertDialogAction>
```
