# Dashboard User-Specific Decks Fix

## Problem
Dashboard was showing mock data instead of real user-specific decks from the database. When a new user signed up, they would see decks that didn't belong to them.

## Solution

### 1. Created Deck Service (`src/services/deckService.ts`)
A complete service layer for deck operations:
- **getUserDecks()** - Fetches all decks for authenticated user with card counts
- **createDeck()** - Creates a new deck
- **getDeck()** - Gets a single deck by ID
- **updateDeck()** - Updates deck information
- **deleteDeck()** - Deletes a deck

### 2. Updated Dashboard (`src/views/Dashboard.tsx`)
Complete rewrite to use real data:
- âœ… Fetches user-specific decks from Supabase
- âœ… Shows loading state while fetching
- âœ… Shows empty state when user has no decks
- âœ… Shows login prompt when not authenticated
- âœ… Displays real card counts per deck
- âœ… Uses actual deck data (name, description, created_at)

### Key Features Implemented

#### Empty State
When user has no decks:
```
ðŸ“¦ No Decks Yet

You haven't created any flashcard decks yet. Get started by uploading your first deck!

[Upload Your First Deck]
```

#### Login Prompt
When user is not logged in:
```
ðŸ“š Welcome to LarahBigDeck

Please log in to view and manage your flashcard decks.
```

#### Loading State
Shows spinner while fetching decks from database

#### Real Deck Cards
Each deck card shows:
- Deck name (from database)
- Description (from database or "No description")
- Card count (queried from cards table)
- Creation date (formatted from created_at)

### Database Integration

The service connects to Supabase and:
1. Checks user authentication
2. Queries `decks` table filtered by `user_id`
3. Counts cards in `cards` table for each deck
4. Returns typed data with proper error handling

### Authentication Flow

```
User Logs In
    â†“
Dashboard mounts
    â†“
useEffect triggers loadDecks()
    â†“
getUserDecks() calls Supabase
    â†“
Supabase checks auth token
    â†“
Returns decks WHERE user_id = current_user
    â†“
Dashboard renders user's decks
```

### Security

âœ… **User Isolation** - Each user only sees their own decks
âœ… **Auth Required** - All deck operations require authentication
âœ… **RLS Enabled** - Row Level Security enforced at database level
âœ… **No Mock Data** - Only real database data is displayed

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `src/services/deckService.ts` - Created new service
2. âœ… `src/views/Dashboard.tsx` - Complete rewrite
3. âœ… Backend API already existed at `src/app/api/decks/route.ts`

## How It Works Now

### For New Users
1. Sign up / Log in
2. Dashboard shows "No Decks Yet" message
3. Click "Upload Your First Deck" button
4. After creating deck, it appears on dashboard

### For Existing Users
1. Log in
2. Dashboard automatically fetches their decks
3. Shows deck cards with real data
4. Click any deck to start studying

## Testing

### Test Empty State
1. Create a new account
2. Log in
3. Should see "No Decks Yet" message
4. No mock decks should appear

### Test With Decks
1. Upload a deck (via Upload page)
2. Go back to Dashboard
3. Should see your uploaded deck
4. Card count should match actual cards in deck

### Test Authentication
1. Log out
2. Should see "Welcome to LarahBigDeck" prompt
3. No decks should be visible
4. Log back in - decks reappear

## Backend API Running

The backend API server is now running on `http://localhost:3001`

Available endpoints:
- GET `/api/decks` - Get user's decks
- POST `/api/decks` - Create new deck
- GET `/api/decks/[deckId]` - Get single deck
- PATCH `/api/decks/[deckId]` - Update deck
- DELETE `/api/decks/[deckId]` - Delete deck

## Environment

**Frontend (Vite):** `http://localhost:8080`
**Backend (Next.js API):** `http://localhost:3001`

Both need to be running:
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev

# Terminal 2
npm run dev:api
```

## Next Steps

When you upload your first deck via the Upload page, it will:
1. Create deck in database with your user_id
2. Upload cards to that deck
3. Deck will automatically appear on Dashboard
4. Card count will be accurate

## Verification Checklist

- âœ… New users see empty state
- âœ… No mock decks appear
- âœ… Login required to see decks
- âœ… Each user only sees their own decks
- âœ… Real card counts displayed
- âœ… Real deck names and descriptions
- âœ… Loading state works
- âœ… Error handling in place
- âœ… Toast notifications on errors
- âœ… Backend API running on port 3001
