# Study Session Tracking Fix

## Problem
Study time, last activity, and active days statistics were not being recorded because:
- Sessions only completed when users finished all cards in a deck
- No tracking when users left the page early, closed browser, or navigated away
- Session data was lost if the user didn't complete 100% of the deck

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive session persistence across multiple scenarios:

### 1. Component Unmount Tracking (`src/views/Study.tsx`)
Added `useEffect` cleanup that automatically completes sessions when:
- User navigates to another page
- Component unmounts for any reason
- Study mode is exited

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (sessionId && isStudying) {
      completeCurrentSession();
    }
  };
}, [sessionId, isStudying]);
```

### 2. Browser Close/Refresh Tracking
Added `beforeunload` event handler using `navigator.sendBeacon()`:
- Reliable async request that works even during page unload
- Sends session completion data before browser closes
- Works for tab close, browser close, and page refresh

```typescript
const handleBeforeUnload = () => {
  if (sessionId) {
    const url = `http://localhost:3001/api/sessions/${sessionId}/beacon`;
    const blob = new Blob(
      [JSON.stringify({ completed_at: new Date().toISOString() })],
      { type: 'application/json' }
    );
    navigator.sendBeacon(url, blob);
  }
};
```

### 3. Tab Visibility Tracking
Added visibility change detection:
- Tracks when user switches tabs
- Automatically completes session if tab is hidden for >5 minutes
- Prevents inflated study time from inactive tabs

### 4. Special Beacon Endpoint (`src/app/api/sessions/[sessionId]/beacon/route.ts`)
Created dedicated endpoint for `sendBeacon()` requests:
- Doesn't require full authentication (uses sessionId)
- Handles CORS properly for cross-origin requests
- Calculates session duration server-side
- Updates database atomically

## How It Works Now

### Session Start
1. User clicks "Start Studying" button
2. `startStudySession()` creates database record
3. `sessionId` and `sessionStartTime` stored in state
4. Event listeners registered for page unload and visibility

### During Study
- Card interactions update stats in real-time
- `last_reviewed_at` updated on each card interaction
- Session remains active in database

### Session End (Multiple Scenarios)

#### Scenario A: Complete All Cards
- User finishes all cards in deck
- `handleNext()` detects end of deck
- Calls `completeStudySession()` with accuracy toast
- Shows completion message

#### Scenario B: Navigate Away
- User clicks back button or navigates to dashboard
- Component unmounts
- `useEffect` cleanup calls `completeCurrentSession()`
- Session saved to database

#### Scenario C: Close Browser/Tab
- User closes browser or tab
- `beforeunload` event fires
- `navigator.sendBeacon()` sends completion request
- Database updated via beacon endpoint

#### Scenario D: Tab Hidden >5 Minutes
- User switches to another tab
- Visibility change detected
- After 5 minutes of inactivity, session auto-completes
- Prevents inflated study time

## Database Updates

### study_sessions Table
Each session now reliably records:
- `started_at`: When study began
- `completed_at`: When session ended (any scenario)
- `duration_seconds`: Calculated server-side from timestamps
- `cards_studied`: Count of cards attempted
- `cards_correct`: Count of correct answers
- `completed`: Boolean flag set to true

### Statistics Calculation
User stats now accurately reflect:
- **Total Study Time**: Sum of all `duration_seconds` from completed sessions
- **Last Activity**: Most recent `last_reviewed_at` from card interactions
- **Active Days**: Unique days with completed sessions in last 30 days

## API Changes

### Modified: `PATCH /api/sessions/[sessionId]/complete`
- Added CORS headers for cross-origin support
- Added OPTIONS handler for preflight requests
- Maintains existing authentication and authorization

### New: `POST /api/sessions/[sessionId]/beacon`
- Special endpoint for `sendBeacon()` requests
- Validates session by ID instead of cookies
- Lighter authentication for page unload scenario
- Returns minimal response for performance

## Testing Scenarios

### ✅ Test 1: Complete Deck
1. Start studying a deck
2. Answer all cards
3. Verify session shows in database with correct duration
4. Check user stats update (study time, last activity, active days)

### ✅ Test 2: Navigate Away
1. Start studying
2. Answer some cards (not all)
3. Click back button or navigate to dashboard
4. Verify partial session saved with actual study time

### ✅ Test 3: Close Browser
1. Start studying
2. Answer some cards
3. Close browser tab/window
4. Reopen and check database
5. Verify session marked complete with correct duration

### ✅ Test 4: Tab Switch
1. Start studying
2. Switch to another tab for >5 minutes
3. Return to study tab
4. Verify session completed automatically

### ✅ Test 5: Page Refresh
1. Start studying
2. Answer some cards
3. Refresh page (F5)
4. Verify session saved before refresh

## Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ **Accurate Study Time**: Every study session counted, not just completed decks
- ✅ **Reliable Statistics**: Last activity and active days always up-to-date
- ✅ **No Lost Progress**: Session data saved even if you leave early
- ✅ **Flexible Study**: Can study any number of cards without losing time

### For Development
- ✅ **Robust Tracking**: Multiple fallbacks ensure data capture
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Separation of beacon endpoint from regular API
- ✅ **Browser Compatible**: Uses modern APIs with proper fallbacks
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Clear event handler lifecycle management

## Technical Details

### Event Listener Lifecycle
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // Setup: Add listeners when studying starts
  if (isStudying && sessionId) {
    window.addEventListener('beforeunload', handleBeforeUnload);
    document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
  }
  
  // Cleanup: Remove listeners and complete session
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('beforeunload', handleBeforeUnload);
    document.removeEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange);
    if (sessionId && isStudying) {
      completeCurrentSession();
    }
  };
}, [sessionId, isStudying]);
```

### Navigator.sendBeacon() Benefits
- **Non-blocking**: Doesn't delay page unload
- **Reliable**: Browser handles request even after page closes
- **Efficient**: Minimal overhead, queued by browser
- **Spec-compliant**: Standard Web API for analytics/tracking

### Duration Calculation (Server-Side)
```typescript
const startedAt = new Date(session.started_at);
const completedAt = new Date();
const durationSeconds = Math.floor(
  (completedAt.getTime() - startedAt.getTime()) / 1000
);
```
