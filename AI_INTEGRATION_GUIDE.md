# AI Flashcard Generation - Integration Guide

## Overview

This document explains the AI-powered flashcard generation feature using Google's Gemini AI. When users upload PDF/DOCX/PPT files, Gemini automatically analyzes the content and generates 10-30 high-quality flashcards.

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### Problem
- The error `[404 Not Found] models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported` was occurring
- The wrong Gemini SDK was being used
- The model name was outdated

### Solution
1. **Updated to Correct SDK**: Changed from `@google/generative-ai` to `@google/genai` (the newer, recommended SDK)
2. **Updated Model Name**: Changed from `gemini-1.5-flash` to `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` (current model)
3. **Fixed API Call Format**: Updated to match the official Google documentation

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Installed
```json
{
  "@google/genai": "^1.27.0",
  "pdf-parse": "^2.4.5"
}
```

### Files Modified

#### 1. `/src/app/api/upload/[uploadId]/process/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Backend API endpoint that processes uploaded files with Gemini AI
- **Key Changes**:
  - Uses `@google/genai` SDK instead of `@google/generative-ai`
  - Calls `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` model
  - Converts uploaded files to base64
  - Sends comprehensive prompt for flashcard generation
  - Parses JSON response (handles markdown code blocks)
  - Creates flashcards in database
  - Updates upload status

#### 2. `/src/services/uploadService.ts`
- **Purpose**: Frontend service for upload operations
- **Added**: `processUploadWithAI(uploadId)` function
- **Function**: Triggers the AI processing endpoint after file upload

#### 3. `/src/views/Upload.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Upload interface
- **Changes**:
  - Updated button text: "Upload & Generate Cards" (idle) / "Processing with AI..." (loading)
  - Added AI processing after file upload
  - Shows progress toasts: "Uploading..." ‚Üí "Processing with AI..." ‚Üí "Success! Created X flashcards"
  - Navigates to study page after successful generation

#### 4. `.env`
- **Added**: `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyDlETuJlc7JIVe6DCQaXGZNz_Eb54NU2vo`

## üéØ How It Works

### User Flow
1. User navigates to Upload page (Upload New Deck)
2. User selects "Upload File" tab
3. User enters deck details (title, description, tags)
4. User uploads a PDF/DOCX/PPT file (max 20MB)
5. File uploads to Supabase Storage
6. AI processing automatically starts
7. Gemini analyzes document and generates 10-30 flashcards
8. Cards are saved to database
9. User is redirected to study page with new deck

### Technical Flow
```
1. User uploads file
   ‚Üì
2. File saved to Supabase Storage (deck-uploads bucket)
   ‚Üì
3. Upload record created in database (status: pending)
   ‚Üì
4. Frontend calls processUploadWithAI(uploadId)
   ‚Üì
5. Backend downloads file from storage
   ‚Üì
6. File converted to base64
   ‚Üì
7. Sent to Gemini API with flashcard generation prompt
   ‚Üì
8. Gemini analyzes content and returns JSON with flashcards
   ‚Üì
9. Backend parses JSON and creates cards in database
   ‚Üì
10. Upload status updated to "completed"
   ‚Üì
11. User sees "Success! Created X flashcards" and redirected
```

## üìù Gemini Prompt Strategy

The prompt instructs Gemini to:
- Create 10-30 flashcards depending on content length
- Mix of flashcard types: standard Q&A and multiple choice
- Focus on key concepts, definitions, facts, processes, relationships
- Provide clear questions and accurate answers
- Add relevant tags to each card
- Return structured JSON format

### JSON Output Format
```json
{
  "flashcards": [
    {
      "question": "What is...",
      "answer": "...",
      "type": "flashcard",
      "tags": ["topic1", "topic2"]
    },
    {
      "question": "Which of the following...",
      "answer": "Correct answer",
      "type": "multiple_choice",
      "options": ["Correct answer", "Wrong answer 1", "Wrong answer 2", "Wrong answer 3"],
      "tags": ["topic1"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Testing

### Prerequisites
1. Backend API running: `npm run dev:api` (port 3001)
2. Frontend running: `npm run dev` (port 8080)
3. Valid Gemini API key in `.env`
4. Supabase configured and running

### Test Steps
1. Log in to the application
2. Navigate to "Upload New Deck"
3. Click "Upload File" tab
4. Fill in deck details:
   - Title: "Test Deck"
   - Description: "Testing AI generation"
   - Tags: "test, ai"
5. Upload a PDF file (recommend using a simple educational PDF)
6. Watch the toasts:
   - "Uploading..." appears
   - "Processing with AI..." appears
   - "Success! Created X flashcards" appears
7. Verify redirection to study page
8. Check that flashcards were generated correctly
9. Test studying the AI-generated cards

### Expected Results
- ‚úÖ File uploads successfully
- ‚úÖ AI processing completes without errors
- ‚úÖ 10-30 flashcards are generated
- ‚úÖ Flashcards contain relevant content from the document
- ‚úÖ Mix of flashcard and multiple choice questions
- ‚úÖ Cards have appropriate tags
- ‚úÖ User can study the generated deck immediately

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Upload failed - GoogleGenerativeAI Error"
**Cause**: Invalid or missing Gemini API key
**Solution**: 
1. Get API key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
2. Add to `.env`: `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`
3. Restart backend: `npm run dev:api`

### Error: "404 Not Found - models/gemini-X not found"
**Cause**: Using outdated model name
**Solution**: Model should be `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` (already fixed in code)

### Error: "Failed to parse AI response"
**Cause**: Gemini returned text that's not valid JSON
**Solution**: 
- Code already handles markdown code blocks
- If persistent, check Gemini response in backend logs
- May need to adjust prompt or add more parsing logic

### Error: "Failed to download file from storage"
**Cause**: File not uploaded properly or storage path incorrect
**Solution**:
1. Check Supabase Storage bucket: `deck-uploads`
2. Verify file exists at path: `{user_id}/{timestamp}-{filename}`
3. Check upload record in database has correct `storage_path` in metadata

### No flashcards generated
**Cause**: Document content not suitable or too short
**Solution**:
- Use documents with clear educational content
- Minimum recommended length: 1-2 pages
- Avoid image-only PDFs (needs text content)

### AI generating too few/many cards
**Cause**: Document length or Gemini's interpretation
**Solution**: 
- Current prompt requests 10-30 cards based on content
- To adjust, modify prompt in `/src/app/api/upload/[uploadId]/process/route.ts`
- Example: Change "10-30" to "15-25" or add specific count

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### Gemini 2.0 Flash Pricing (as of Oct 2024)
- **Input**: $0.075 per 1M tokens
- **Output**: $0.30 per 1M tokens

### Estimated Costs
| Document Size | Est. Input Tokens | Est. Output Tokens | Est. Cost per Upload |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| 5 pages       | ~2,000            | ~800               | $0.00039            |
| 10 pages      | ~4,000            | ~1,200             | $0.00066            |
| 20 pages      | ~8,000            | ~1,500             | $0.00105            |
| 50 pages      | ~20,000           | ~2,000             | $0.00210            |

**Note**: Costs are estimates. Actual costs depend on content complexity and formatting.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
