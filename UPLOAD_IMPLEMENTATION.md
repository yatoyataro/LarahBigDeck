# Upload Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The Upload feature has been completely integrated with the backend API and Supabase database. Users can now create flashcard decks in two ways:
1. **Manual Creation** - Create cards one by one with custom questions/answers
2. **File Upload** - Upload PDF/DOCX/PPT files for future AI processing

## Implementation Details

### 1. Upload Service (`src/services/uploadService.ts`)

#### Functions Implemented:

**`createDeckWithCards(input)`**
- Creates a new deck with multiple cards in one transaction
- Validates all cards before creation
- Automatically handles card positioning
- Rolls back deck creation if cards fail
- Returns deck object and card count

**`uploadFile(file, deckName, deckDescription)`**
- Creates deck first
- Uploads file to Supabase Storage (`deck-uploads` bucket)
- Creates upload record in database with status 'pending'
- Returns deck and upload objects
- Clean up on failure (removes file and deck)

**`getUploadStatus(uploadId)`**
- Fetches current status of an upload
- Useful for tracking AI processing progress

### 2. Updated Upload Page (`src/views/Upload.tsx`)

#### New Features:

**Authentication Check**
- Requires user to be logged in
- Shows error toast if not authenticated

**Two Creation Modes**

**Tab 1: Upload File**
- Drag and drop support
- File validation (PDF, DOCX, PPT/PPTX)
- Size limit: 20MB
- Creates deck and uploads to Supabase Storage
- Ready for AI processing (future feature)

**Tab 2: Create Manually**
- Add/remove cards dynamically
- Each card has:
  - Question/Term field
  - Answer/Definition field
  - 4 Multiple choice options (optional)
- Automatic card type detection:
  - If options filled: `multiple_choice`
  - If no options: `flashcard`
- First option is always correct answer
- Validation for all required fields

**Form State Management**
- Deck title (required)
- Deck description (optional)
- Loading states during submission
- Error handling with toast notifications
- Success feedback and navigation

### 3. Database Integration

#### Tables Used:

**`decks` table**
```sql
- id (uuid)
- user_id (uuid) - Foreign key to auth.users
- name (text)
- description (text, nullable)
- created_at (timestamptz)
- updated_at (timestamptz)
```

**`cards` table**
```sql
- id (uuid)
- deck_id (uuid) - Foreign key to decks
- question (text)
- answer (text)
- card_type (enum: flashcard, multiple_choice, true_false)
- options (jsonb, nullable)
- correct_option_index (integer, nullable)
- tags (jsonb, nullable)
- position (integer)
- difficulty (numeric, default 2.5)
- times_reviewed (integer, default 0)
- times_correct (integer, default 0)
- created_at (timestamptz)
```

**`uploads` table**
```sql
- id (uuid)
- user_id (uuid) - Foreign key to auth.users
- deck_id (uuid, nullable) - Foreign key to decks
- file_name (text)
- file_url (text)
- file_size (integer)
- mime_type (text)
- status (enum: pending, processing, completed, failed)
- metadata (jsonb)
- created_at (timestamptz)
```

#### Row Level Security (RLS)
All tables have RLS policies that ensure:
- Users can only see their own decks
- Users can only create/update/delete their own content
- No user can access another user's data

### 4. API Endpoints Used

**POST `/api/decks`**
- Creates a new deck
- Requires authentication
- Returns created deck object

**POST `/api/decks/[deckId]/cards`**
- Creates a card in specified deck
- Validates deck ownership
- Handles card positioning automatically

**POST `/api/upload`** (not directly used, but available)
- Handles file upload to storage
- Creates upload record
- Ready for background processing

### 5. User Flow

#### Manual Creation Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Upload New Deck"
2. Fills in deck title & description
3. Switches to "Create Manually" tab
4. Fills in card 1:
   - Question: "What is React?"
   - Answer: "A JavaScript library for building UIs"
   - Options (optional):
     - "A JavaScript library" (correct)
     - "A programming language"
     - "A database"
     - "An operating system"
5. Clicks "Add Another Card" for more cards
6. Clicks "Create Deck"
7. System:
   - Creates deck in database with user_id
   - Creates all cards with proper positioning
   - Shows success toast
   - Redirects to dashboard
8. Deck appears on dashboard immediately
```

#### File Upload Flow:
```
1. User clicks "Upload New Deck"
2. Fills in deck title & description
3. Stays on "Upload File" tab
4. Drags and drops PDF file OR clicks "Browse Files"
5. File validates (type, size)
6. Shows file name and icon
7. Clicks "Upload Deck"
8. System:
   - Creates deck in database
   - Uploads file to Supabase Storage
   - Creates upload record (status: pending)
   - Shows success toast
   - Redirects to dashboard
9. Deck appears on dashboard (0 cards initially)
10. Background job would process file (future feature)
```

### 6. Validation Rules

**Deck Validation:**
- âœ… Title is required and non-empty
- âœ… Description is optional
- âœ… User must be authenticated

**Card Validation (Manual):**
- âœ… Question is required and non-empty
- âœ… Answer is required and non-empty
- âœ… If options provided, at least 2 are required
- âœ… First option is always the correct answer

**File Validation (Upload):**
- âœ… File type: PDF, DOCX, PPTX only
- âœ… File size: Max 20MB
- âœ… File must be selected before upload

### 7. Error Handling

All operations include comprehensive error handling:
- Authentication errors â†’ Prompt to log in
- Validation errors â†’ Specific field feedback
- Network errors â†’ Retry instructions
- Database errors â†’ User-friendly messages
- File upload errors â†’ Clean up and notify

### 8. Security Features

âœ… **Authentication Required** - All operations check auth status
âœ… **User Isolation** - Decks linked to user_id
âœ… **RLS Enabled** - Database enforces access control
âœ… **File Storage Security** - Files stored with user_id prefix
âœ… **Input Validation** - All fields validated before submission
âœ… **SQL Injection Protected** - Using Supabase client (parameterized queries)

### 9. Storage Configuration

**Supabase Storage Bucket: `deck-uploads`**
- Public access for reading (files are public URLs)
- Write access only for authenticated users
- Files organized by user_id: `{user_id}/{timestamp}-{filename}`
- Automatic cleanup on failed uploads

### 10. Future Enhancements Ready

**AI Processing Pipeline (Placeholder):**
The file upload system is ready for AI integration:
```typescript
// After file upload, you can add:
1. Trigger Edge Function or serverless function
2. Extract text from PDF/DOCX/PPT
3. Send to OpenAI/Claude/Custom AI model
4. Parse response into cards
5. Create cards in database
6. Update upload status to 'completed'
```

The `uploads` table tracks:
- File location
- Processing status
- Associated deck_id
- Metadata for debugging
