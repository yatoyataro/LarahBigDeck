# Study Page - Backend Integration Fix

## Problem
- Created decks were showing on the Dashboard
- Clicking "Start studying â†’" showed "Deck not found"
- Cards were not loading from the database
- Study page was using mock data (`mockDecks`) instead of real backend data

## Root Cause
The Study page (`src/views/Study.tsx`) was using hardcoded mock data from `@/data/mockData` instead of fetching real deck and card data from the Supabase database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `getDeckCards()` Function to `deckService.ts`

**New Function:**
```typescript
export async function getDeckCards(deckId: string): Promise<Card[]>
```

**Features:**
- Fetches all cards for a specific deck
- Validates deck ownership (checks user_id)
- Orders cards by position
- Returns empty array if deck has no cards
- Throws error if deck not found or access denied

**Card Interface:**
```typescript
export interface Card {
  id: string
  deck_id: string
  question: string
  answer: string
  card_type: 'flashcard' | 'multiple_choice' | 'true_false'
  options: string[] | null
  correct_option_index: number | null
  tags: string[] | null
  position: number
  difficulty: number
  times_reviewed: number
  times_correct: number
  created_at: string
}
```

### 2. Updated `Study.tsx` to Use Real Backend Data

**Changes Made:**

**Imports:**
- Removed: `import { mockDecks } from "@/data/mockData"`
- Removed: `import { Card as CardType } from "@/data/mockData"`
- Removed: `import { toast } from "sonner"`
- Removed: `import * as statsService from "@/services/statsService"`
- Added: `import * as deckService from "@/services/deckService"`
- Added: `import { useToast } from "@/hooks/use-toast"`
- Added: `import { useAuth } from "@/hooks/useAuth"`

**State Management:**
- Added `deck` state for storing deck details
- Added `loading` state for loading indicator
- Added `error` state for error messages
- Changed card type from mockData Card to deckService.Card

**Data Fetching:**
- Added `useEffect` to fetch deck and cards on component mount
- Fetches deck details using `deckService.getDeck(deckId)`
- Fetches cards using `deckService.getDeckCards(deckId)`
- Validates user authentication before fetching
- Shows loading state while fetching
- Shows error state if deck not found

**UI Updates:**
- Changed `deck.title` to `deck.name` (matches database schema)
- Changed `deck.description` handling (nullable in database)
- Added loading screen: "Loading deck..."
- Added error screen with "Back to Dashboard" button
- Changed toast from sonner to shadcn/ui toast

**Removed Features (Temporarily):**
- Stats service integration (will be added later)
- Session tracking (will be added later)
- Card flagging persistence (currently client-side only)

### 3. Updated Component Type Definitions

**FlipCard.tsx:**
- Changed: `import { Card as CardType } from "@/data/mockData"`
- To: `import { Card as CardType } from "@/services/deckService"`

**MultipleChoice.tsx:**
- Changed: `import { Card as CardType } from "@/data/mockData"`
- To: `import { Card as CardType } from "@/services/deckService"`

**CardEditor.tsx:**
- Changed: `import { Card as CardType } from "@/data/mockData"`
- To: `import { Card as CardType } from "@/services/deckService"`
- Updated `handleAddCard()` to create cards with all required fields:
  - `deck_id`, `card_type`, `position`, `difficulty`, etc.
  - Defaults: `card_type: 'flashcard'`, `difficulty: 2.5`

## User Flow Now

### Successful Flow:
```
1. User logs in
2. User clicks "Upload New Deck"
3. User creates deck with cards (manual or upload)
4. Deck appears on Dashboard
5. User clicks "Start studying â†’"
6. Study page loads:
   âœ… Fetches deck from database
   âœ… Fetches cards from database
   âœ… Displays deck name and description
   âœ… Shows all cards in CardEditor
7. User clicks "Start Studying"
8. Cards are displayed one by one
9. User can flip cards or answer multiple choice
```

### Error Handling:
```
- No deckId in URL â†’ Error: "No deck ID provided"
- User not logged in â†’ Error: "Please log in to view this deck"
- Deck not found â†’ Error: "Deck not found"
- Access denied â†’ Error: "Deck not found or access denied"
- Network error â†’ Error: "Failed to load deck"
```

## Database Schema Used

### `decks` table:
- `id` - UUID
- `user_id` - UUID (foreign key to auth.users)
- `name` - Text (deck title)
- `description` - Text, nullable
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `updated_at` - Timestamp

### `cards` table:
- `id` - UUID
- `deck_id` - UUID (foreign key to decks)
- `question` - Text
- `answer` - Text
- `card_type` - Enum: flashcard, multiple_choice, true_false
- `options` - JSONB (array of strings), nullable
- `correct_option_index` - Integer, nullable
- `tags` - JSONB (array of strings), nullable
- `position` - Integer (order in deck)
- `difficulty` - Numeric (default 2.5)
- `times_reviewed` - Integer (default 0)
- `times_correct` - Integer (default 0)
- `created_at` - Timestamp

## Security

**Row Level Security (RLS):**
- Users can only fetch their own decks
- `getDeck()` checks both `id` AND `user_id`
- `getDeckCards()` first validates deck ownership
- No user can access another user's cards

## Testing Checklist

âœ… **Test 1: View Existing Deck**
- Create a deck with cards
- Click "Start studying â†’" from dashboard
- Deck should load successfully
- Cards should be displayed

âœ… **Test 2: Empty Deck**
- Create a deck with 0 cards
- Click "Start studying â†’"
- Should show deck name
- Should show empty card list
- Should show "Add card" button

âœ… **Test 3: Authentication**
- Log out
- Try to access `/study/:deckId` directly
- Should show "Please log in" error

âœ… **Test 4: Invalid Deck ID**
- Try to access `/study/invalid-uuid`
- Should show "Deck not found" error

âœ… **Test 5: Another User's Deck**
- Get deck ID from another user
- Try to access it
- Should show "Deck not found" (due to RLS)

## Next Steps

**Future Enhancements:**
1. Add stats service integration
   - Track study sessions
   - Track card review history
   - Calculate accuracy and time spent

2. Add card flagging persistence
   - Save flagged cards to database
   - Load flagged status on page load

3. Add spaced repetition algorithm
   - Calculate next review date
   - Adjust card difficulty based on performance

4. Add study session summary
   - Show session stats at end
   - Display accuracy, time, cards reviewed

5. Add offline support
   - Cache decks locally
   - Sync when online

## Conclusion

The Study page now fully integrates with the backend:

- âœ… Validates user authentication
- âœ… Enforces row-level security
- âœ… Shows proper loading and error states
- âœ… Works with user-created decks from Upload page

**The "Deck not found" issue is now fixed!** ðŸŽ‰
